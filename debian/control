Description: Automates interactive applications
 Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script.
 Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what
 the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same
 applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in
 X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
 structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
 interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.
